/**
 * THE CANVAS GATE for the Stage 1 trace-overlay rebuild.
 *
 * Everything the view model proves in isolation, proved again where it
 * actually has to hold: on the real `ContextViewCanvas`, driven the way a
 * reader drives it — select the dashboard, press Trace Lineage, look.
 *
 * The claim in one line: a trace draws the focus's chain open, its partners
 * CLOSED with honest counts, one wire per flow at the grain the reader has
 * earned — and writes NOTHING to the canvas store, so leaving it puts the
 * canvas back exactly as it was.
 *
 * GREEN since the canvas swap (Task 8): the canvas renders the overlay's
 * lanes and wires, and every path that used to grow the store during a trace
 * — the walk merge, expand-fetch, reveal, load-more — now yields to it. This
 * file is what keeps it that way.
