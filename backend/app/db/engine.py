"""
SQLAlchemy async engine and session factory for the management database.

Synodic is **Postgres-only** (Postgres v16+) for both development and
production. SQLite is no longer supported — the dialect-asymmetry tax
on Phase 2 concurrency, Phase 1.5 schema namespaces, and migration
discipline outweighed the dev-ergonomics benefit. Spin up the dev
Postgres via `docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d`.

Required env var:
    MANAGEMENT_DB_URL   e.g. postgresql+asyncpg://synodic:synodic@localhost:5432/synodic

Usage:
    async with get_async_session() as session:        # web pool (default)
        result = await session.execute(...)

    async with get_jobs_session() as session:         # jobs pool
        ...   # aggregation worker, scheduler, outbox relay

    async with get_readonly_session() as session:     # readonly pool
        ...   # readiness / drift / status probes

    async with get_admin_session() as session:        # admin pool
        ...   # alembic runner, lifespan init

Per-role pools (plan Gap 3): the four engines above are backed by the
same Postgres role today but separate connection pools, so a runaway
aggregation worker cannot exhaust the pool that FastAPI request
handlers drain from. Bulkhead within a single process, no new infra.
Role-level Postgres grants (plan Gap 2) can layer on top without
changing the shape here.
